- Work evidence-first. Before editing, read `model.py` and the task-scoped SDK documentation working set.
- Do not keep planning in assistant text. Once you know the next concrete step, use a tool.
- Build from grounded evidence:
  1. Inspect the current code and relevant docs.
  2. Identify the root body, articulated parts, joint origins, joint axes, motion limits, visible realism features, and exact tests.
  3. Make one coherent implementation pass that creates a connected, mechanically credible baseline.
  4. Run `compile_model`.
  5. Repair compile/QC failures directly; use `probe_model` only when spatial evidence is needed.
- Treat overlap failures by classifying them first. Some overlaps are visually and mechanically valid, such as seated parts, hinge barrels, nested hardware, captured pins, and small hidden inserts. When an overlap is intentional and local, silence it with a scoped `ctx.allow_overlap(...)` plus an exact proof check instead of distorting the visible geometry to remove it.
- Prefer a small complete object over scattered details. The first working version must have the primary mechanism, physical support, plausible proportions, and clear requested identity.
- After every code mutation, compile before concluding.
- If compile succeeds but a requested mechanism, support, visible feature, material/color, or exact test is missing, make one focused edit and compile again.
- Conclude only after the latest revision compiles cleanly and you cannot name a specific remaining defect.

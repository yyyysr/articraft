<tools>
- Available tools: `read_file`, `replace`, `write_file`, `compile_model`, `probe_model`, `find_examples`, and `find_materials`.
- `read_file` reads exact virtual workspace file text. Use `read_file(path="model.py")` for the current full model script, and `read_file(path="docs/...")` for read-only SDK references.
- `replace` performs surgical text replacement in `model.py`.
- `write_file` rewrites the full `model.py` script when a larger replacement is intentional; include imports, `build_object_model()`, `run_tests()`, and `object_model = build_object_model()`.
- `compile_model` runs compile + QC and returns structured `<compile_signals>`.
- `probe_model` is read-only Python inspection; no file writes, no object mutation, and no subprocesses.
- `find_examples` searches curated SDK examples for patterns. Adapt results against current SDK docs and do not mechanically copy example code; entries marked `[weakly relevant]` are inspiration-only.
- `find_materials` searches installed visual-material descriptions and returns exact catalog/name pairs. Use it only when a catalog finish adds value; ordinary inline materials remain valid.
- Prefer small exact `replace` edits over broad rewrites.
- If `replace` fails because `old_string` did not match, call `read_file(path="model.py")` again and retry with a smaller exact snippet.
- Modify the existing `model.py`; use `write_file` only when you intentionally want to replace the whole script.
- When you no longer need tools, conclude instead of continuing to reflect in text.
- After a clean compile on the latest revision, conclude immediately unless you can name one specific unresolved defect.
- Do not do extra verification, review chatter, or refinement passes after success without a named defect.

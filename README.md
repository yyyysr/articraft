**An Agentic System for Scalable Articulated 3D Asset Generation.**

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15187) | [Project Page](https://articraft3d.github.io/) | [Dataset](https://github.com/mattzh72/articraft-data)

Articraft transforms the creation of articulated 3D assets into a programmatic, code-generation workflow powered by LLMs. It is now a local-first harness: this repo contains the generation/viewer logic, while the public dataset lives separately at [`mattzh72/articraft-data`](https://github.com/mattzh72/articraft-data).

> **Security Note:** Articraft compiles and inspects generated records by executing their `model.py` files as Python code. Only run generated records and model scripts from trusted sources.

---

## Quickstart

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 recommended (or 3.11). *Note: 3.13+ is not currently supported.*
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for incredibly fast Python package management.
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as the command runner.
- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (optional, but needed for local viewer frontend).

### 2. Setup
From the repo root, run:
```bash
just setup
```
To set up a checkout from another working directory, pass the repository root:
```bash
just setup ./path/to/checkout
```

Articraft stores records in a gitignored data root. By default that is `<repo-root>/data`. To browse the released dataset, clone [`mattzh72/articraft-data`](https://github.com/mattzh72/articraft-data) and point Articraft at it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattzh72/articraft-data.git ../articraft-data
export ARTICRAFT_DATA_DIR="$(cd ../articraft-data && pwd)"
uv run articraft status
uv run articraft library check --require-records
```

You can also pass any data folder explicitly with `--data-dir`.

### Optional Texture Catalog Assets

The optional AmbientCG texture downloader is maintained inside Articraft,
separate from the GenScene application scripts. From this directory, preview
the curated wood set with:

```bash
python scripts/download_texture.py --dry-run
```

Download the selected 1K-PNG assets into
`assets/textures/wood_furniture/` with:

```bash
python scripts/download_texture.py
```

The source CSV is kept beside the script at
`scripts/ambientCG_downloads_csv.csv`. Use `--asset-id` to select specific
assets, `--attribute` to choose another available download variant, or
`--output-dir` to override the catalog texture root. The downloaded files are
optional and are consumed by the `wood_furniture` material catalog; the core
Articraft SDK and GenScene do not require them.

### 3. Add API Keys
Open `.env` and set one or more provider keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEYS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEYS`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`).

> **No API Keys?** No problem. You can use external AI agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor instead. For Codex setup, including how to add the Codex plugin, see [Codex Plugin Setup](docs/codex_plugin.md). Then point the agent at this repository and prompt it:
> 
> *"Create a realistic articulated [object name] in Articraft. Follow EXTERNAL_AGENT_DATA.md."*

### 4. Create an Asset

Generate your first model directly from a prompt using `articraft generate`:
```bash
uv run articraft generate "Create a realistic articulated desk lamp with a weighted base, two hinged arms, and an adjustable lamp head."
```

If you specify no overrides, it uses `ARTICRAFT_MODEL` and `ARTICRAFT_THINKING_LEVEL` from `.env` when present, otherwise `--model gpt-5.5-2026-04-23 --thinking-level high`. You can change models and caps:
```bash
uv run articraft generate --max-cost-usd 1.5 "Create a compact desk fan with adjustable tilt."
```

To generate from a reference image, see [Image-Conditioned Generation](docs/image_conditioned_generation.md).

### 5. Open the Viewer
Browse the objects you just generated. The local viewer API and React frontend can be started with:
```bash
just viewer
```

To browse an external data folder explicitly:

```bash
uv run articraft viewer --data-dir /Users/mzhou/articraft-data
```

### 6. Edit an Existing Asset
Fork an existing record when you want to modify it:
```bash
uv run articraft fork <record_id> "make the handle longer"
```

Forking creates a new child record and leaves the parent unchanged. See [Editing Existing Records](docs/record_editing.md) for model options and history viewing.

## Local Library

Use the compact library surface to inspect and maintain the data folder:

```bash
uv run articraft library list
uv run articraft library rebuild-manifest
uv run articraft library check --require-records
uv run articraft library set-category <record_id> <category_slug>
```

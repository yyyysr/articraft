# SDK Quickstart

## Purpose

Use this page to start a new Articraft SDK script. It defines the required
script contract, the authoring workspace rules, and one minimal end-to-end
example.
Detailed APIs live in the mounted `docs/sdk/references/...` files listed below.

## Virtual Workspace

You are editing a virtual authoring workspace.

- `model.py` is the only writable file.
- `docs/sdk/references/quickstart.md` is this always-loaded entrypoint.
- Everything under `docs/` is read-only SDK guidance.
- Import from `sdk` in `model.py`.
- Use `read_file(path=...)` to load exact reference text only when needed.

## Import Contract

Authoring helpers are exposed as top-level public imports from `sdk`.
The mounted docs are grouped by topic for reading convenience; those filenames
do not imply matching Python submodules.

```python
# Correct
from sdk import ArticulatedObject, MotionLimits, place_on_face

# Wrong
from sdk.placement import place_on_face
from sdk.core_types import MotionLimits
```

## Mounted Reference Layout

Always available in `docs/sdk/references/`:

- `quickstart.md`: script contract, workspace rules, minimal example, workflow, and the
  full reference inventory.
- `errors.md`: common compile and authoring failures, plus how to interpret them.
- `core-types.md`: geometry, material, articulation, and test-related core
  types, plus optional inertial helpers.
- `material-catalogs.md`: optional searchable visual-material catalogs,
  per-visual binding, renderer fallbacks, and textured-material requirements.
- `articulated-object.md`: object, part, and articulation authoring helpers and lookup
  patterns.
- `assets.md`: explicit asset-root helpers for standalone scripts and tests.
- `placement.md`: placement helpers for mounting, offsets, wrapping, and alignment.
- `probe-tooling.md`: `probe_model` helper catalog and inspection workflow.
- `testing.md`: `TestContext`, `expect_*` assertions, and test authoring patterns.
- `cadquery/overview.md`: when and why to use CadQuery-style geometry in Articraft.
- `cadquery/primer.md`: CadQuery mental model and core shape-building workflow.
- `cadquery/workplane.md`: workplane-based modeling patterns and common operations.
- `cadquery/sketch.md`: sketch-driven 2D profiles and profile construction tools.
- `cadquery/assembly.md`: CadQuery assembly helpers and composition patterns.
- `cadquery/gears.md`: vendored gear builders and the preserved `Workplane.gear()`
  plugin workflow.
- `cadquery/free-functions.md`: free-function geometry helpers and utility builders.
- `cadquery/api-ref.md`: compact CadQuery API reference and signatures.

Additional geometry references:

- `geometry/mesh-geometry.md`: mesh generation flow, managed meshes, and mesh-based
  low-level geometry helpers.
- `geometry/panels-and-grilles.md`: perforated panels, slotted panels, and full vent
  grilles.
- `geometry/brackets-and-mounts.md`: clevises, forks, and yoke-style support members.
- `geometry/fans-and-rotors.md`: axial fan rotors and blower wheels.
- `geometry/knobs-and-controls.md`: knobs, dial caps, grip details, and shaft bores.
- `geometry/wires.md`: wire and path construction helpers.
- `geometry/section-lofts.md`: section lofts, repairs, and section-driven geometry.
- `geometry/bezels-and-frames.md`: bezels, framed openings, recesses, and trim
  surrounds.
- `geometry/wheels-and-tires.md`: wheel structure, tire carcasses, tread, and sidewalls.
- `geometry/hinges.md`: exposed barrel and piano hinge helpers.

If a prompt clearly names a semantic part family such as a knob, bezel, wheel,
tire, vent grille, bracket, or hinge, read that focused geometry page before
falling back to the low-level mesh page.

Read the exact document you need. Do not guess helper names or signatures from memory.

When a named realistic surface finish would materially improve the object, call
`find_materials` and use an exact returned catalog/name pair. Do not read the
material USD and do not invent catalog names. Catalog use is optional: retain
ordinary `rgba` or `texture` materials when they are adequate. Read
`docs/sdk/references/material-catalogs.md` only when using this workflow.

## Script Contract

Every generated script should define:

- `build_object_model() -> ArticulatedObject`
- `run_tests() -> TestReport`
- `object_model = build_object_model()`

`compile_model` compiles `object_model`, derives exact collisions from visuals,
runs tests, and exports the result. Do not emit URDF XML directly.

`compile_model` also owns the baseline sanity/QC pass. It automatically checks
model validity, exactly one root part, mesh assets, floating disconnected part
groups, disconnected geometry islands inside a part, and current-pose real 3D
overlaps.

## Recommended Imports

```python
from sdk import (
    ArticulatedObject,
    ArticulationType,
    Box,
    MotionLimits,
    Origin,
    TestContext,
    TestReport,
)
```

## Managed Mesh Pattern

Use logical mesh names. Articraft manages the materialized OBJ asset paths.

- Generate procedural meshes with `mesh_from_geometry(..., "part_name")`.
- Import existing OBJ inputs with `mesh_from_input("mesh_name")`.
- Use `TestContext(object_model)`; do not wire asset roots manually.
- If you are writing a standalone local script and need a stable asset root,
  read `docs/sdk/references/assets.md`.

## Minimal Example

```python
from sdk import (
    ArticulatedObject,
    ArticulationType,
    Box,
    MotionLimits,
    Origin,
    TestContext,
    TestReport,
)


def build_object_model() -> ArticulatedObject:
    model = ArticulatedObject(name="example_box_lid")

    base = model.part("base")
    base.visual(
        Box((0.20, 0.20, 0.05)),
        origin=Origin(xyz=(0.0, 0.0, 0.025)),
        name="base_shell",
    )

    lid = model.part("lid")
    lid.visual(
        Box((0.18, 0.18, 0.02)),
        # The lid part frame sits on the hinge line; the panel extends along +X.
        origin=Origin(xyz=(0.09, 0.0, 0.01)),
        name="lid_shell",
    )

    model.articulation(
        "base_to_lid",
        ArticulationType.REVOLUTE,
        parent=base,
        child=lid,
        # Positive q should open the lid upward, not into the base.
        # Because the closed lid extends along local +X from the hinge,
        # choose -Y so positive rotation lifts the free edge toward +Z.
        origin=Origin(xyz=(-0.09, 0.0, 0.05)),
        axis=(0.0, -1.0, 0.0),
        motion_limits=MotionLimits(effort=5.0, velocity=3.0, lower=0.0, upper=1.2),
    )

    return model


def run_tests() -> TestReport:
    ctx = TestContext(object_model)
    base = object_model.get_part("base")
    lid = object_model.get_part("lid")
    hinge = object_model.get_articulation("base_to_lid")

    with ctx.pose({hinge: 0.0}):
        ctx.expect_gap(lid, base, axis="z", max_gap=0.001, max_penetration=0.0)
        ctx.expect_overlap(lid, base, axes="xy", min_overlap=0.05)

    return ctx.report()


object_model = build_object_model()
```

This example uses a hinge-line part frame for the lid. At `q=0`, the child
frame coincides with the articulation frame at the left edge of the lid. Since
the closed lid panel extends along local `+X` from that hinge, `axis=(0, -1, 0)`
makes positive angles open upward.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Derive a compact internal Articraft brief from the prompt.
2. Build parts with `model.part(...)`.
3. Add visuals with `part.visual(...)`.
4. Add motion with `model.articulation(...)`.
5. Add prompt-specific `expect_*` assertions in `run_tests()`.
6. Use `allow_overlap(...)` and `allow_isolated_part(...)` only when the
   intended mechanism genuinely requires those exceptions.

`part.inertial` is optional. Add it only when a downstream simulation or
export consumer needs explicit mass properties.

## Articraft Brief

Before coding, translate the user's prose into a short internal Articraft brief.
Do not ask the user to provide this structure. Use it to make the first
implementation pass coherent and to choose tests that prove the requested object,
not just that the model compiles.

Use only the fields that matter for the prompt:

```text
Articraft brief:
- Object: real object identity and approximate real-world scale.
- Root/support: fixed body or frame that carries the assembly.
- Parts: major authored parts and why they are separate or fused.
- Articulations: joint name, parent, child, type, frame/origin idea, axis,
  positive motion, and limits.
- Visible geometry: prompt-critical shapes, openings, cavities, controls,
  materials, and colors.
- Support/fit: how separate parts mount, contact, clear, nest, or retain.
- Intentional overlaps: none, or exact local embeddings that need allowances.
- Tests: prompt-specific checks and decisive pose checks.
- Assumptions: meaningful inferred choices.
```

For simple static objects, the brief may only need object, root/support, visible
geometry, tests, and assumptions. For mechanism-heavy objects, explicitly name
each moving part and what positive motion should do before writing the joint.

Example:

```text
Articraft brief:
- Object: 13-inch laptop, about 0.30 x 0.21 m footprint.
- Root/support: base chassis is root; screen is carried by rear hinge barrels.
- Parts: base chassis, screen lid, keyboard keys or rows, trackpad.
- Articulation: base_to_screen, REVOLUTE, rear hinge line, axis chosen so
  positive q opens the screen upward/backward, limits 0 to about 2.1 rad.
- Visible geometry: thin base shell, raised keys, dark display inset, hinge
  cylinders, restrained metal/plastic materials.
- Support/fit: hinge barrels contact the rear base edge and lower display edge.
- Intentional overlaps: small hinge-pin/barrel embedding only if simplified.
- Tests: screen exists, hinge positive pose raises display, closed pose seats
  near base, hinge support remains connected.
- Assumptions: generic laptop proportions, no port-level detail.
```

## Authoring Habits

- Model visible openings, cavities, and hollow bodies explicitly. Do not cap a
  visible opening with a solid placeholder.
- If the object is layered or nested, model those layers with clear visual
  separation instead of collapsing them into one solid mass.
- Preserve the visible construction logic of major faces and covers. If a
  visible surface should read as one continuous piece, keep it connected and
  cut openings into it rather than replacing it with floating fragments.
- Hidden supports and internal structure can stay simple as long as the visible
  form reads correctly.
- Within one part, avoid disconnected visual islands. If a feature should read
  as mounted, give it a real rib, bracket, pin, collar, stem, or wall
  connection, or split it into a separate part.
- For mounted child parts, prefer placement helpers over hand-tuned
  `Origin(...)` offsets.
- Use `place_on_surface(...)` by default for rigid mounts onto housings,
  shells, panels, pedals, feet, knobs, buttons, pads, brackets, and similar
  surface-mounted parts.
- Use `place_on_face(...)` or `place_on_face_uv(...)` only when the parent is
  truly box-like and the semantic reference is a specific face.
- Use `proud_for_flush_mount(...)` when a centered child should sit flush
  instead of half-embedded.
- Use restrained real-world materials and colors rather than placeholder
  defaults.

# Wires, Tubes, and Frames

## Purpose

Use this stack for thin curved parts such as handles, loops, whisk cages, fan
guards, baskets, and tubular frames. Start with the spline helpers for almost
all continuously bent parts.

This is a geometry detail page. It describes continuous wire, tube, frame, and
rail construction but does not define rigid-part boundaries or motion. Read
`docs/sdk/references/articulated-object.md` when the resulting geometry belongs
to a moving part.

## Import

```python
from sdk import (
    WirePath,
    tube_from_spline_points,
    sweep_profile_along_spline,
    rounded_rect_profile,
)
```

## Recommended APIs

| Shape intent | Helper |
| --- | --- |
| Default for smooth circular rails, handles, loops, and frames | `tube_from_spline_points(...)` |
| Default for smooth non-circular rails and trim | `sweep_profile_along_spline(...)` |
| Readable manual path authoring for smooth arcs and bezier-like runs | `WirePath` plus a spline/sweep helper |

## API Reference

### `tube_from_spline_points(...)`

```python
tube_from_spline_points(
    points,
    *,
    radius: float,
    samples_per_segment: int = 12,
    closed_spline: bool = False,
    spline: str = "catmull_rom",
    alpha: float = 0.5,
    radial_segments: int = 16,
    cap_ends: bool = True,
    up_hint=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
    min_segment_length: float = 1e-6,
) -> MeshGeometry
```

- Fits a spline through the input points, then builds a circular tube.
- `spline`: `"catmull_rom"` or `"bezier"`.
- `alpha`: Catmull-Rom parameter, used only for `"catmull_rom"`.
- `closed_spline`: closes the fitted path.
- `cap_ends`: adds end caps when the path is open.

### `sweep_profile_along_spline(...)`

```python
sweep_profile_along_spline(
    points,
    *,
    profile,
    samples_per_segment: int = 12,
    closed_spline: bool = False,
    spline: str = "catmull_rom",
    alpha: float = 0.5,
    cap_profile: bool = True,
    up_hint=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
    min_segment_length: float = 1e-6,
) -> MeshGeometry
```

- Fits a spline through the input points, then sweeps a closed 2D profile.
- Use this when the section is not circular.

### `WirePath`

```python
WirePath(start)
WirePath.from_points(points) -> WirePath
```

Methods:

```python
wp.line_to(point) -> WirePath
wp.line_by(dx, dy, dz) -> WirePath
wp.bezier_to(control1, control2, end, *, samples=12) -> WirePath
wp.arc(*, center, normal, angle, segments=16) -> WirePath
wp.extend(points) -> WirePath
wp.to_points() -> list[tuple[float, float, float]]
```

Use `WirePath` when readability matters more than fitting a spline from an
existing point set. In most cases, finish with `wp.to_points()` and feed the
result into `tube_from_spline_points(...)` or `sweep_profile_along_spline(...)`
so the final visible part remains a smooth swept tube.

## Advice

### Default decision order

- If the part should read as one continuously bent tube or wire, start with
  `tube_from_spline_points(...)`.
- If the part should read as one continuously bent rail but the section is not
  circular, use `sweep_profile_along_spline(...)`.
- Use `WirePath` when the path is easier to author procedurally than to specify
  as a finished point list, then pass `wp.to_points()` into a spline/sweep
  helper.

### Tuning smoothness

- Increase `samples_per_segment` first when a spline-based result looks coarse.
- Increase `radial_segments` when the tube still looks visibly faceted.

## Examples

### Smooth handle

```python
handle = tube_from_spline_points(
    [
        (-0.03, 0.00, 0.00),
        (-0.01, 0.02, 0.01),
        (0.01, 0.02, 0.01),
        (0.03, 0.00, 0.00),
    ],
    radius=0.002,
    samples_per_segment=18,
    radial_segments=20,
    cap_ends=True,
)
```

### Custom-profile rail

```python
trim = sweep_profile_along_spline(
    [
        (-0.04, 0.00, 0.00),
        (-0.01, 0.02, 0.01),
        (0.02, 0.01, 0.01),
        (0.05, 0.00, 0.00),
    ],
    profile=rounded_rect_profile(0.004, 0.002, radius=0.0007),
    samples_per_segment=18,
    cap_profile=True,
)
```

### Readable smooth path with `WirePath`

```python
wp = (
    WirePath((-0.03, 0.00, 0.00))
    .bezier_to(
        (-0.02, 0.02, 0.01),
        (0.02, 0.02, 0.01),
        (0.03, 0.00, 0.00),
        samples=18,
    )
)

handle = tube_from_spline_points(
    wp.to_points(),
    radius=0.002,
    samples_per_segment=6,
    radial_segments=20,
    cap_ends=True,
)
```

Use this pattern when arcs or bezier-like runs are easier to author
procedurally but the final part should still read as one continuous bend.

## Clarifications for agent usage

- Spline/path angle conventions use radians and the right-hand rule.
- `spline="bezier"` expects chained cubic Bezier control points rather than a generic interpolating spline-through-points contract. For an open chain, `(n - 1) % 3 == 0`; for a closed chain, the authored point list must already close back on itself.
- `up_hint` defines the transported frame used to orient swept profiles. Changing it changes the profile roll even when the path points stay fixed.
